## ðŸ‘¤ About Me
I am Abegain Venezia Chauke, a final-year student pursuing a Diploma in Communication Networks at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. I am passionate about designing, securing, and managing network systems that support modern communication technologies.

I have gained practical and theoretical knowledge in network security, IP addressing, network configurations, and Linux operating systems, along with experience using tools like Cisco Packet Tracer. I am fluent in English, isiZulu, and Xitsonga, and I enjoy working in both collaborative and independent environments.

As someone who is goal-driven and detail-oriented, I am now looking to apply my skills in areas such as cybersecurity, communication infrastructure, and network design, and contribute meaningfully to innovative IT projects.

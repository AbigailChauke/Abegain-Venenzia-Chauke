## ðŸ‘¤ About Me
I am Abegain Venezia Chauke, a final-year student pursuing a Diploma in Communication Networks at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. I am passionate about designing, securing, and managing network systems that support modern communication technologies.

I have gained practical and theoretical knowledge in network security, IP addressing, network configurations, and Linux operating systems, along with experience using tools like Cisco Packet Tracer. I am fluent in English, isiZulu, and Xitsonga, and I enjoy working in both collaborative and independent environments.

As someone who is goal-driven and detail-oriented, I am now looking to apply my skills in areas such as cybersecurity, communication infrastructure, and network design, and contribute meaningfully to innovative IT projects.






## 1. Career Counselling
###  Evidence
I attended the Career Counselling Session in 2025 focused on ICT career paths. It provided insight into roles like Network Analyst, Security Specialist, and Infrastructure Support. We were ask to come up with a problem that we also need to provide a solution ourselves for it as a group.
